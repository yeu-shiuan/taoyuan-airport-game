            <ol>
                <li>1. Agreement to Rules: By filling out and uploading entry data, participants are deemed to agree to
                    the rules, important notes, and relevant regulations of this activity. In the event of a violation,
                    the Organizer reserves the right to disqualify the participant or revoke the prize. If such
                    violation causes loss to the Organizer, the participant shall be liable for damages.
                </li>
                <li>2. Truthfulness of Information: Participants guarantee that all information submitted is true,
                    complete, and accurate, and that they have not used the data of any third party. False, incomplete,
                    or incorrect information will result in disqualification from participation or winning. If the
                    Organizer is unable to notify the winner due to incorrect information, it will be considered a
                    forfeiture of the prize, and no notification or replacement will be issued. The participant shall
                    bear all responsibilities if the provided information infringes upon the rights of others or causes
                    damage to the Organizer or any third party. Each person is limited to receiving one prize; if a
                    person wins multiple times, the prize with the higher value will be prioritized.
                </li>
                <li>3. Claiming Prizes: Winners must complete the claim documents as required by the Organizer within
                    the specified notification period. Failure to do so will be considered a waiver of the right to the
                    prize, and no replacement will be issued. If the identification documents provided do not match the
                    winner's data, the Organizer may request relevant proof. If no proof is provided or the content does
                    not match, the Organizer reserves the right to revoke the winner's eligibility.
                </li>
                <li>4. Tax Regulations: In accordance with the tax laws of the Republic of China, if the prize value
                    exceeds NT$1,000, the prize income will be included in the individual's annual comprehensive income
                    tax return. Therefore, winners must fill out and submit the relevant receipts and a copy of their ID
                    card to claim the prize. If the total value of the prize exceeds NT$20,000, a 10% tax must be paid
                    or withheld in advance. Refusal to comply will be strictly considered a voluntary waiver of the
                    prize, and eligibility will be revoked.
                </li>
                <li>5. Shipping: Prize delivery is limited to the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu areas. Winners
                    outside these areas will be deemed to have waived the prize. The Organizer will not reissue or
                    replace prizes lost or damaged during the mailing process.
                </li>
                <li>6. Prize Specifications: Prizes are subject to the information published on this website, and the
                    actual items shall prevail. The Organizer reserves the right to replace the prize with another item
                    of equivalent value. Prizes for this activity cannot be converted, transferred, or exchanged for
                    cash.
                </li>
                <li>7. Minors: If the winner is a minor, they must attach a household registration transcript and
                    provide a consent form from a legal guardian to claim the prize.
                </li>
                <li>8. Fair Play: If a participant is found to be using malicious programs or other methods that
                    obviously violate the fairness of the activity to influence the progress or results, the Organizer
                    may immediately disqualify the participant or revoke the prize. The participant shall be liable for
                    any damages caused to the Organizer.

                <li>9. Force Majeure: In the event that this activity cannot be executed due to force majeure, the
                    Organizer reserves the right to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend the activity. Participants may

                    unrecognizability, or damage to the data sent or registered by participants due to computer,
                    network, telephone, technical issues, or matters not attributable to the Organizer. Participants
