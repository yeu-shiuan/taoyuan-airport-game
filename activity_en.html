            <h1>【Campaign Period & Draw Rules】</h1>

            <h2>I. Campaign Period:</h2>
            <p>From 00:00 on December 22, 2025 (Mon) to 23:59 on January 4, 2026 (Sun).</p>

            <h2>II. Eligibility:</h2>
            <p>(1) Open to participants of all ages.<br>
                (2) Winners must present identification documents for verification when claiming prizes.
            </p>

            <h2>III. Draw Time & Announcement:</h2>
            <p>The Organizer will conduct the draw on January 6, 2026 (Tue), and the list of winners will be announced
                on the campaign website on January 7, 2026 (Wed).</p>

            <h2>IV. How to Participate:</h2>
            <p>(1) Participants must complete the quiz on the campaign website (total of 8 questions). After completing
                the quiz and reaching the result page, participants must fill out the basic information page. Once
                successfully submitted, the participant qualifies for the draw.<br>
                (2) Participants may complete the challenge daily during the campaign period to accumulate draw entries.
                However, each participant is limited to winning one prize only, and the prize with the higher value will
                be prioritized. (Example: If the same participant wins multiple prizes, the one with the highest value
                will be the final prize, and the others will be deemed automatically forfeited.)
            </p>

            <h2>V. Prizes:</h2>
            <p> • [500 Points for 4 Major Convenience Stores (No Expiration Date)] – 20 Winners<br>

            <h2>【Eligibility & Data Entry Standards】</h2>
            <p>
                I. By filling out information or uploading entry materials, participants are deemed to have fully read
                and agreed to these Campaign Rules, notices, and related regulations. In the event of a violation, the
                Organizer may cancel the participant's eligibility or winning qualification and may claim compensation
                for any resulting damages.<br>
                II. Participants must guarantee that all information filled in or provided is true, complete, accurate,
                and does not infringe upon the rights of third parties; participants shall not use false identities,
                misappropriated information, or provide false reports.<br>
                III. If the data is false, incomplete, incorrect, or involves impersonation or infringement, the
                Organizer may cancel the participant's eligibility or winning qualification. If this results in the
                Organizer being unable to notify the winner, it shall be deemed a waiver of the prize, and no further
                notice or replacement will be given.<br>
                IV. If a participant uses attack programs, external plug-ins, or other actions that affect the fairness
                of the campaign, the Organizer may immediately cancel their qualification and claim compensation for
                damages caused by such actions.
            </p>

            <h2>【Winner Notification & Redemption Rules】</h2>
            <p>
                I. The Organizer will notify winners and send prizes based on the email address provided by the
                participant. If data is missing, delivery fails, or the response is overdue, it will be deemed a waiver
                of the prize, and no further notice will be given. The Organizer may select an alternate winner.<br>
                II. Winners must complete the prize claim documents and provide relevant identification proof within the
                deadline specified by the Organizer. Failure to complete this within the deadline or providing
                non-conforming data will be considered a waiver, and no replacement will be issued.
                <br>
                III. If the data in the winner's identification documents does not match the registered data, the
                Organizer may request supplementary proof. If the winner cannot provide it, the Organizer may cancel
                their winning qualification.
                <br>
                IV. If the winner is a minor, they must provide a Household Registration Transcript and a Consent Form
                from a Legal Guardian to claim the prize.
                <br>
                V. In accordance with the tax laws of the Republic of China, if the prize value exceeds NT$1,000, the
                income will be included in the individual's annual comprehensive income tax declaration. Therefore, the
                winner must fill out the required forms and submit a receipt and a copy of their ID to claim the prize.
                If the total prize value exceeds NT$20,000, a 10% tax must be paid or withheld in advance. Refusal to
                comply will be deemed an automatic waiver of the right to the prize and disqualification.
                <br>
                VI. Prizes are subject to the website announcement and actual items. The Organizer reserves the right to
                substitute prizes of equal value. Prizes cannot be converted, transferred, or exchanged for cash.
            </p>
